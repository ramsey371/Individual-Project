# Individual-Project

This project serves as an art render for space scenes, where the user will add text to a text box such as commands like (add star at 200 100, or add planet at 200 300)
and a random planet and or star will be generated as follows. The parse takes two inputs whether that be a star or planent and the add functions with specifiers for color and size of planets.

This program also has command parsing and exception hadling to add objects to the canvas.
